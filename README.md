Corona color plugin
===================

Something I use when prototyping new ideas is to quickly get up and running using a nice color palette that is easy to manage. This plugin is one of the base plugins I use in all my new projects.

Getting started
---

1. Setup this repo as a submodule in your Corona directory.
2. `local Colors = require("colors.plugin")`

See `main.lua` in this repo for examples of how to use the plugin.
